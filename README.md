# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

 Starting with a template containing some backend functionality, students were responsible for developing the front-end and responsive features of the application with Ajax, jQuery, Javascript, CSS, HTML and SASS. 
 
This project was a part of the Lighthouse Labs web development program.
